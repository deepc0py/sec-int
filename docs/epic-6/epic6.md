# Actionable Development Plan: Minimum Viable Product for a Vulnerability Analysis RAG Bot

## Epic 6: MVP Application and Deployment

This final epic focuses on packaging the entire system into a deployable, testable application. It involves creating an API endpoint to expose the bot's functionality, containerizing the application for portability, and implementing an end-to-end test suite to ensure all components work together correctly.

### User Story 6.1: Develop a Basic API Endpoint (e.g., FastAPI) to Trigger the Bot

**User Story:**
As a developer, I need to create a simple web server with a single API endpoint that can receive a vulnerability scan report, trigger the analysis, and return the final summary.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A main.py file is created to house the FastAPI application.
- A single POST endpoint (e.g., /analyze) is defined.
- The endpoint accepts a JSON payload containing the raw scan report text.
- When called, the endpoint invokes the analyze_scan_report orchestrator function.
- The endpoint returns the formatted final report as a JSON response with a 200 status code upon success.
- Appropriate error handling is implemented to return a non-200 status code if the analysis fails.

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
FastAPI is the natural choice for the web framework, given that Pydantic AI was heavily inspired by it and the two libraries share the same underlying Pydantic models for data validation.1 This creates a seamless development experience. The Pydantic AI RAG tutorial itself provides an example of using a FastAPI backend.3 The endpoint will use Pydantic to define the expected request body, automatically handling input validation and documentation generation.

### User Story 6.2: Containerize the Application for Deployment

**User Story:**
As a DevOps engineer, I need a Dockerfile to package the entire Python application and its dependencies into a standardized container image, so that it can be deployed consistently across different environments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A Dockerfile is created in the project root.
- The Dockerfile uses a suitable Python base image (e.g., python:3.11-slim).
- It copies the project's source code and dependency files (pyproject.toml, poetry.lock) into the image.
- It installs the project dependencies using the lock file to ensure reproducible builds.
- It defines the command to run the application using uvicorn.
- The resulting image is optimized for size and security (e.g., by using a multi-stage build and running as a non-root user).

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
Containerization is the modern standard for deploying applications. A Dockerfile provides a reproducible recipe for building an image that contains the application, its runtime, and all its dependencies. This eliminates "works on my machine" problems and simplifies deployment to any container orchestration platform (like Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, or cloud services like AWS ECS or Google Cloud Run). A multi-stage build is a best practice where one stage is used to build the application and install dependencies, and a final, smaller stage copies only the necessary artifacts, resulting in a more secure and efficient production image.

### User Story 6.3: Implement End-to-End Integration Test Suite

**User Story:**
As a quality assurance engineer, I need an end-to-end integration test suite that validates the entire application workflow, from API request to the final generated response, to ensure all components are working together correctly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A new test file (test_integration.py) is created.
- The test suite uses a test client (e.g., FastAPI.TestClient) to make live requests to the application's API endpoint.
- A small, static set of test data is created, including a sample scan report and a corresponding mock knowledge base.
- The tests mock the database connection and the OpenAI API calls to ensure tests are fast, deterministic, and do not incur costs.
- One test case sends a sample scan report to the /analyze endpoint and asserts that it receives a 200 OK response.
- Another test case validates the structure and content of the returned analysis, ensuring it matches the expected format defined by the Pydantic models.

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
While unit tests are essential for verifying individual components, integration tests are crucial for ensuring the entire system works as a cohesive whole. Pydantic AI's dependency injection system is specifically designed to facilitate testing. The documentation highlights the ability to override dependencies during testing.27

In our integration test, we can use the agent.override(deps=test_deps) context manager to inject a mock database connection. This allows the test to simulate the retrieval process without needing a running PostgreSQL instance. Similarly, the OpenAI API calls can be patched using a library like pytest-mock. This allows us to provide a canned response for the LLM generation step, making the test's outcome predictable and independent of the actual LLM's performance. This level of testability is a key feature of a well-architected, production-ready application.
